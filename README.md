# 911 Calls Data Capstone Project

This project analyzes a dataset of 911 emergency calls to extract meaningful insights. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and others for data manipulation, statistical calculations, and visualization.

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**
The dataset contains information about 911 calls, including timestamps, locations, call types, and more. This project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in the data to gain deeper insights into emergency response operations.

---

## 🛠️ **Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Statistical computations and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Basic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced and aesthetically pleasing plots.
- **Datetime**: Time-based analysis.

## 🔍 **Key Analyses Performed**
1. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Monthly, daily, and hourly trends in 911 calls.
   - Identified peak times for different types of emergencies.

2. **Categorical Analysis**:
   - Analyzed common reasons for calls (e.g., medical, fire, traffic).
   - Grouped calls by call type and location.

3. **Geospatial Insights**:
   - Heatmaps to visualize the distribution of calls across regions.
   - Correlated call volume with specific geographic locations.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Seasonal trends in call frequency.
   - Comparison of emergency types over time.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Cluster maps and line plots for trend analysis.
   - Heatmaps for showing correlations.

## 📂 **Dataset**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the 911 call.
- **Type**: Type of emergency (e.g., traffic, fire, medical).
- **Location**: Geographic location of the incident.
- **Description**: Brief description of the call.
- **Additional Fields**: Other relevant details about the call.

> Note: The dataset is publicly available and was cleaned and preprocessed for better analysis.
